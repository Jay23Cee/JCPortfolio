## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: Vite is a fast, opinionated frontend build tool that optimizes the development experience. It enables quick and efficient project setup, hot module replacement (HMR), and near-instantaneous rebuilds for faster development iterations.
- **React**: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based approach to UI development, making it easier to manage and reuse UI elements.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that enhances developer productivity and code quality. It adds static types, allowing for better code documentation, autocompletion, and catching errors before runtime.
